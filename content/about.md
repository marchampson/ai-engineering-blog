# About Me

I've been a professional developer for 30 years, with experience at IBM, Amazon, and for the last 11 years heading up development at WK360. My work has focused on creating specialized enterprise software solutions, including systems that manage the entire lifecycle of packaging artwork from initial brief to print production, asset management platforms with flexible data modeling capabilities, and dynamic QR code management systems.

As AI increasingly handles many traditional development tasks, I've become interested in how my role as a developer is evolving into that of an AI engineer. This blog documents my journey and insights into this transformation.

## My Background

- 30 years of professional development experience

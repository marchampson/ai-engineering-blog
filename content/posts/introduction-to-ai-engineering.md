# Introduction to AI Engineering

As software development evolves with artificial intelligence becoming more mainstream, the role of developers is transforming. After 30 years as a professional developer working with technologies from IBM systems to Laravel PHP applications, I've witnessed numerous paradigm shifts. However, none are as profound as the current AI revolution.

## What is AI Engineering?

AI Engineering sits at the intersection of software development and artificial intelligence. It's a discipline focused on:

- Integrating AI capabilities into existing software systems
- Designing systems that leverage AI for automation and intelligence
- Creating workflows that combine human expertise with AI capabilities
- Developing strategies for effective AI adoption

Unlike traditional software engineering, AI engineering requires understanding both the technical implementation and the conceptual foundations of artificial intelligence.

## Why Traditional Developers Should Care

As more routine coding tasks become automated through AI tools like GitHub Copilot and sophisticated LLMs, traditional developers have two choices:

1. Compete with AI on routine coding tasks (a losing proposition)
2. Evolve to become AI engineers who can orchestrate, direct, and enhance AI capabilities

The second path represents the future of software developmentâ€”working alongside AI rather than being replaced by it.

## The Skill Transition

Moving from traditional development to AI engineering requires:

- Understanding prompt engineering
- Learning the capabilities and limitations of different AI models
- Developing systems thinking for AI integration
- Building expertise in human-AI collaboration

## Looking Ahead

This blog will explore the journey from traditional software development to AI engineering, covering both high-level concepts and practical implementations. We'll start with foundational AI concepts, move into the specifics of large language models, and eventually explore the technical details of tokens, parameters, and implementation strategies.

Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to evolve your career or someone interested in the changing landscape of software development, this journey will provide insights into how AI is reshaping our industry.
